# openkey translator

a simple web app to translate from [openkey](https://gist.github.com/jasonm23/9c7b54c1a00e55ef3bfea187bf4ad7c0) to musical keys or vice-versa.

for example, you can translate `12m` to `D Minor`, or the other way around.

## local development

### prereqs

you must have `git`, `node.js`, and `npm` installed locally. i am using `node@22.12.0` but any reasonably recent version should work.

### install dependencies

install local dependencies with `npm i`

### spin up local dev server

to start the dev server, run `npm run dev`
